# Selection-Operator

An activity on Sololearn where you are creating a program to manage smartphones. The given code declares a Phone class, with its constructor and two methods: use() and getCharge().

A Phone object is declared in main. Complete the code to call the getCharge() method using the correct selection operator.

*The p.getCharge() syntax is used when you have an object, and you want to call a member function on that object directly.
*The ptr->getCharge() syntax is used when you have a pointer to an object, and you want to call a member function on the object through the pointer. This arrow operator (->) is a shorthand notation for accessing a member through a pointer.
